## Method, provenance, and learning

Class-prior baseline fitted on training labels. Neural architecture, optimizer, batches and epochs do not apply. The committed study source defines prediction behavior.

Real-label models should outperform the label-shuffled control; the primary decay effect may be positive, negative, or inconclusive.

One random example split without writer IDs; conditional intervals exclude training-population uncertainty.
