## Method, provenance, and learning

Multinomial logistic regression: C=1.0, max_iter=1000. Neural architecture, AdamW, batches and epochs do not apply. See the [scikit-learn estimator](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html).

Real-label models should outperform the label-shuffled control; the primary decay effect may be positive, negative, or inconclusive.

One random example split without writer IDs; conditional intervals exclude training-population uncertainty.
